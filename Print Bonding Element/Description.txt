Write a program to print the elements, whose addition of adjacent elements is equal to that element (Except first and last element).

Input

You are provided with a set of integers separated by white spaces in a single line. You can assume the minimum value is -9999999 and the maximum value is 9999999.

Output

Find the elements, whose addition of adjacent elements is equal to that element and print the elements in a single separated line by white spaces (Note: The output should be in ascending order, Ex: 20 23 40).

Example

Input:
13 294 24 88 64 111 47

Output:
88 111
Explanation

In the above example, 4th element (88) is addition of adjacent elements 3rd and 5th element (24 and 64) and the same for 6th element (64 + 47 = 111). And the output is already in ascending order, so no changes required in the order. Output value is 88 111
